class Monitor():
    """Monitor for early stopping in Gradient Boosting for classification.

    The monitor checks the validation loss between each training stage. When
    too many successive stages have increased the loss, the monitor will return
    true, stopping the training early.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X_valid : array-like, shape = [n_samples, n_features]
      Training vectors, where n_samples is the number of samples
      and n_features is the number of features.
    y_valid : array-like, shape = [n_samples]
      Target values (integers in classification, real numbers in
      regression)
      For classification, labels must correspond to classes.
    max_consecutive_decreases : int, optional (default=5)
      Early stopping criteria: when the number of consecutive iterations that
      result in a worse performance on the validation set exceeds this value,
      the training stops.
